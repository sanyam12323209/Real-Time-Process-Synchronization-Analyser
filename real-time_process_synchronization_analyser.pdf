Real-Time Thread Monitoring: Overview
1. What This Tool Does
Live Thread Monitoring:
This application captures real-time thread data from your laptop. It uses the Python psutil library to gather information about processes and their thread counts.

Visual Representation:
On the left side, it displays a scrolling log of processes with their respective thread counts. On the right side, it shows a bar chart of the top five processes using the most threads at any given time.

User Interactions:

Refresh Now: Forces an immediate update of the data.

Exit: Closes the application gracefully.

Periodic Updates: By default, the tool automatically updates every few seconds (the refresh interval can be changed).

2. What the Screenshot Shows
Left Panel (Live Thread Log):
Each line indicates the time, process name, PID (Process ID), and thread count for that process. This log is updated on every refresh interval or manual refresh.

Right Panel (Top 5 Processes by Thread Count):
A horizontal bar chart displaying the five processes with the highest thread counts. The process name and PID are labeled along the y-axis, and the x-axis shows the thread count. Longer bars mean more threads.

Status Bar (Bottom):
Shows how many processes were monitored in the latest snapshot.

3. Why Itâ€™s Useful
Real-Time Insights:
Quickly see which processes consume the most threads on your system, potentially helping to identify performance bottlenecks or resource-heavy applications.

Diagnostic Tool:
Useful for understanding how many threads each process is running and whether certain applications are spawning excessive threads.

Simple GUI:
The Tkinter interface makes it easy to view updates, refresh data, or exit without needing to dive into command-line tools.

4. Getting Started
Install Dependencies

psutil for process/thread info

matplotlib for the chart

tkinter (usually comes with Python on Windows)

Run the Script

bash
Copy
Edit
python live_thread_monitor.py
(Adjust the file name if yours is different.)

View the Data

The window will open, automatically populating the log panel with real-time data.

The bar chart on the right displays the top five processes by thread count.

5. Limitations
Platform Specific:
Although psutil is cross-platform, certain data might vary by OS.

Resource Usage:
Scanning processes and retrieving thread info can be somewhat CPU-intensive, but this script limits scanning to the top 50 processes to reduce overhead.

6. Additional Notes
This tool is primarily for monitoring and demonstration.

If you need more advanced features (like historical data or alerts), you can extend the code or use specialized profiling tools.
