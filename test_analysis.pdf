## Functionality Explanation

### 1. Overview

This project is a **Real-Time Process Synchronization Analyzer** that **simulates** thread synchronization behavior using randomly generated data. It’s primarily a **teaching/demo tool** that shows how logs might look and how a wait-for graph could appear in a real multi-threaded application.

### 2. Key Components

1. **Log Simulator (LogSimulator Class)**  
   - Runs in a **background thread** and generates fake log messages (e.g., “Thread 3 acquired lock on MutexA”) at random intervals.  
   - Mimics the idea of multiple threads acquiring resources in real-time.

2. **Wait-For Graph (GraphUpdater Class)**  
   - Creates a **directed graph** of threads (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5).  
   - Randomly generates edges (arrows) to simulate one thread waiting on another thread.  
   - Uses **networkx** and **matplotlib** to visualize the graph in a Tkinter frame.

3. **GUI (SynchronizationAnalyzerApp Class)**  
   - Built with **Tkinter** to provide an interactive interface.  
   - Displays:
     - **Log Messages** on the left (scrollable text area).  
     - **Simulated Wait-For Graph** on the right (matplotlib figure).  
   - **Buttons** at the bottom/top to pause/resume logs, restart the simulation, refresh the graph, and save a snapshot of the current graph.

### 3. How It Works

1. **Initialization**  
   - The `SynchronizationAnalyzerApp` sets up the main window, frames, and widgets (log area, graph area, status bar, etc.).  
   - A `LogSimulator` thread starts and begins generating log messages.

2. **Log Generation**  
   - The simulator thread creates entries like:  
     ```
     10:23:45 - Thread 2 acquired lock on MutexA
     ```
   - Each entry is inserted into the **Log Messages** area.  
   - A counter tracks the total number of generated log messages, displayed on the status bar.

3. **Graph Updating**  
   - The `GraphUpdater` class randomly creates or refreshes a directed graph of five nodes (T1 to T5).  
   - Each refresh picks random nodes to connect with edges, simulating “waiting on” relationships.  
   - The graph is drawn using **matplotlib** embedded in a Tkinter frame.

4. **User Interaction**  
   - **Pause/Resume Logs**: Temporarily halts the simulator thread from generating new messages.  
   - **Restart Logs**: Stops the existing log simulator, clears the log area, and starts a new simulator thread.  
   - **Refresh Graph**: Regenerates the wait-for graph with new random edges.  
   - **Save Graph Snapshot**: Prompts you to save the current graph as a `.png` file.

5. **Closing the App**  
   - When you close the window (or click the exit button), the `on_close` method stops the log simulator, waits briefly for it to finish, and then closes the Tkinter application.

### 4. How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Python 3.8+  
   - `pip install networkx matplotlib`
2. **Run the Script**  
   - `python your_script_name.py`
3. **Observe**  
   - A window opens with two sections (Log Messages on the left, Graph on the right).  
   - Messages appear in real time; the graph displays a random wait-for scenario.

### 5. Limitations & Notes

- **Random Data**: The code uses random numbers and edges to demonstrate concurrency visualization. It does **not** hook into actual OS-level thread data.  
- **Educational Purpose**: Ideal for learning or demos about concurrency visualization—**not** a production-ready analyzer for real processes.  
- **Thread Safety**: The design uses a background thread for log generation, so the GUI remains responsive.
